## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need an environment for jupyter notebook. I ran all commands on AWS conda_amazonei_mxnet_p36. You should be able to execute code with python3.X.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Nowadays Understanding user behavior and taking actions based on data is a key for customer success and profitability. Starbuck coffee, a coffee chain in America has successfully developed a mobile application platform to achieve this. Once every few days, Starbuck sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement fo a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks.

In this project, I ran multiple machine learning models to find out which model performs the best for predicting if users will complete a given offer.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

### Data set
- `portfolio.json` - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- `profile.json` - demographic data for each customer
- `transcript.json` - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

### Files
- `proposal.pdf` - original proposal for the project.
- `report.pdf` - main project summary paper based on proposal.
- `Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook file used for this project.
